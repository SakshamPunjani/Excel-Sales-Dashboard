# Excel-Sales-Dashboard
This sales dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a company's performance across various dimensions. It includes filters for product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) and years (2014-2017). The dashboard features five key visualizations: 1) Sales by Sub-Category, showing a breakdown of product types with phones and chairs leading; 2) Sales by Category over time, indicating growth in Technology and Office Supplies but a decline in Furniture; 3) Sales by States, displayed on a US map; 4) Top 5 Customers by Profit, with Tamara Chand appearing as the top customer; and 5) Monthly Sales, showing fluctuations throughout the year with a significant spike in the final months.
